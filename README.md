## Overview  
This is a snapshot of the work done so far on the linking writing processes kaggle competition. Will update it periodically to reflect changes made. Could be useful for anyone trying to take a stab at the project. Will update totality at the end of the competition.

## Setup  
If you want to run the notebooks, you'll have to install the data from the kaggle competition and place the csvs in the data folder, download requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and you're good to go.
