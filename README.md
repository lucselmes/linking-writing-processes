## Overview  
Providing a snapshot of the work done so far on the linking writing processes kaggle competition. Will update it periodically to reflect changes made. May not provide all work immediately in order to preserve competitive edge. Will update totality at the end of the competition.

## Setup  
If you want to run the notebooks, you'll have to install the data from the kaggle competition and place the csvs in the data folder, download requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and you're good to go.
